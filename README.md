**Development Environment**  
This repository contains a pre-configured Dev Container using Docker. When opened in Visual Studio Code with the Dev Containers extension, the development environment is automatically provisioned with:
- required extensions;
- Python dependencies: from each requirements.txt;
- C++ toolchain;
- all necessary configurations.

This allows you to run and develop the code without installing anything locally, other than Docker and VS Code.

**Quick Start**
1. Install Docker.
2. Install Visual Studio Code.
3. Install the Dev Containers extension.
4. Open the repository in VS Code and select "Reopen in Container".
